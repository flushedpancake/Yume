playing with you~
playing with dreams
messing with yume's new commands
gazing at the stars
hovering above the sky
hiding under your bed
playing on your mind
drifting over space and time
gaming with nynim
finding the essence of life
comforting you
snuggling and cuddling
contemplating life itself
on the tracks of the thought train
playing alongside everyone, fighting against no one
swirling in the summer's sunbeams
whirling in the winter's wonders
bringing people together in unity and brotherhood
chirping away in peace and harmony
climbing over there somewhere
sleeping in
fighting against Brazil's taxation bullshit
listening to Barry Leitch soundtracks
listening to Amiga tracker stuff
an angel of dreams that's no devil in disguise
