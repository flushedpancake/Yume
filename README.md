# Yume Bot

Yume is a Discord bot focused on being able to do a little bit of everything, with an emphasis on entertainment and fun commands.

Yume has been entirely built with the new Discord slash commands in mind.

You can see all the planned commands (and their development status) [here](https://github.com/users/AkkoS2/projects/12/views/1).
